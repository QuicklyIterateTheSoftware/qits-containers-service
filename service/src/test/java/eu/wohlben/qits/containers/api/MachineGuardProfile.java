/**
 * The deployment posture after the gate flips: {@code qits.auth.machine.required=true}. Everything
 * else here exists to make that posture testable without a qits-idp.
 *
 * <p><b>The verification key is inlined instead of fetched.</b> {@code quarkus.oidc.public-key}
 * puts the extension into local verification, and {@code auth-server-url} is cleared beside it — the
 * key alone is not enough, because a tenant that still has a server URL tries to reach it on the
 * first bearer and answers 500 when it cannot. Clearing the URL also drops the issuer that came
 * with it, so {@code token.issuer} is stated explicitly and {@code iss} stays checked. The
 * signature and {@code aud=qits-platform} are the shipped configuration, checked by the real
 * extension exactly as they will be against the real idp.
 *
 * <p><b>The dev user is switched off</b>, and that is load-bearing rather than tidy. Under
 * {@code %test} qits-auth-core ships {@code qits.auth.forward.dev-user=dev}, so forward-auth
 * authenticates every request and a bearer would never reach the token mechanism. Empty reads back
 * as absent, which is the state a production build is always in.
 *
 * <p>The driver is the fake, for the reason every gate suite has one: what is under test is who may
 * call, and a guard that passed should not start a container to prove it.
